          As practice shows, programming alone isn't enough to make a website
          work for you. That's why many stakeholders pay great attention to
          design and marketing. Respectively, your web development team should
          fit the project's objectives and consist of specialists with diverse
          skills and knowledge.

          While some companies provide it's customers with the full circle of
          specialists they may need for the project, others do not. That's
          especially true for young and narrowly focused firms.

          may have it's own spectrum of services and the number of web
          development team members can vary. Let’s consider the core web
          development team roles, required skills and talents, that will make
          together a strong base for a good team.

          The main task of this specialist is to take your vision of the
          project, analyze it, and translate into comprehensive technical
          specifications. In turn, these specifications will be used by the web
          development team to set time frames and get ready for the project.

            >create a SaaS application</a
          >
          for retail operations or marketing project software for digital
          agencies, the first question an analyst will ask you is, “What goals
          do you want to accomplish with your product? First of all, the
          requirements analyst needs to define your business needs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Div-2">
        <p>
          However, the web development team won’t be able to create an actual
          product based on raw requirements. A business analyst needs to
          transform this information into a clear
          <a
            href="https://www.cleveroad.com/documents/project-specification-example.pdf"
            >project specification</a
          >
          that the team can guide. Shortly, an analyst details what each part of
          the web app must accomplish, what each feature is responsible for,
          what buttons should be clicked to perform a specific action, etc.
